____________________________________
What could be done with more time
____________________________________

- Obviously, complete the code
- Added unit test cases with mocks
- Added proper UI and css
- Deployed on Heroku
- I would have preferred to build it on existing frameworks like Angular JS 1.5/2 or React JS
  It provides a lot better structure and make it easy and fast to build an application.
  Creating different components could have made this really easy.
- remove consoles.
